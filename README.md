# TsicSensor
Arduino library for reading TSIC temperature sensors

This library reads temperature values from several TSIC sensor types (TSIC 206/306/506/516/716). It uses interrupts to decode the ZACwire protocol used by the sensors and supports methods for reading temperature values in several scales (Celsius/Fahrenheit/Kelvin).
